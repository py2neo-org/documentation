iPy2neo is an interactive console for py2neo written and maintained by [Nigel Small](https://github.com/technige) which allows for much of the py2neo functionality to be accessed from outside of a Python application. This tool includes an interactive console that can be used for running Cypher queries and facilities for managing auth files and has multi-database support. Currently iPy2neo is part of the main Py2neo library but this is on track to becoming a separate project.
